# Things you could do

If you're looking for ways to contribute, here are some ideas:

- **Add a License File** â€“ Ensure the project has a clear open-source license.
- **Remove Unused Files** â€“ Delete `rewriteRules.php` if it's no longer needed.
- **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines** â€“ Configure tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Travis CI**, or **StyleCI** for automated testing and code quality checks.
- **Enhance Documentation** â€“ Expand the `README.md` with detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Improve Code Structure** â€“ Refactor and optimize existing code for better readability and maintainability.
- **Add Tests** â€“ Write unit and integration tests to improve reliability.

Your contributions are always welcome! ðŸš€

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


**Happy coding**!
